# MARCH-W
The official tree of the MARCH W Virtual CPU. Written in C++, you can build it on any platform, but we support only Windows and most Linux platforms for Servers.

# Welcome to the MARCH W Virtual CPU.
#What is MARCH?

The MARCH is Virtual CPU Architecture that is realized on the C++ Programming language. You can modify your processor just by coding with C++. But you should learn, we won't accept other's modification that is not very important, for example, we will accept your modification if is a critical bug or security issue.

# Why I should use MARCH?
By using MARCH, you can learn how to code on assembly, and learn how you can debug your software without using an IDE. For example, in Assembly, you can't use IDE Software, because there is full control over your memory and you should limit yourself and control what you do or else your CPU will crash (Software will stop, not physically your CPU.)
